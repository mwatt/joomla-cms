<h1>System Information</h1>


<div style="text-align: right;">--- draft 4.5.3<br /></div><br />The <span style="font-weight: bold;">System Information </span>page provides detailed information about the system that your Joomla! site is deployed on. This includes version information for the site OS, My SQL, PHP, Web server, and Mambo. It also includes the relevant PHP settings and the permissions necessary for Joomla! functions and features to work correctly.<br /><br />The information on this page is very useful to Joomla! developers when they are trying to help you fix a bug with Mambo. For this reason, it is good practice to post this information along with bug reports or support requests to the Joomla! forums.<br /><br />The system information can be reached by selecting System-&gt;System Info from the Administration Menu.<br /><br /><h2>Navigator</h2>These links display 3 groups of information:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">System Info</span><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">PHP Info</span><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Permissions</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>System Information</h2>This
a broad snapshot of the server and versions of the current installation
components of your Joomla! site. Here you will find your PHP build and
version, your MySQL database version along with the Joomla! version and
relevant settings that your server has set that might interfere with
your current site installation.<br /><br />It also displays the content of your Joomla! configuration.php file. This file is
produced when you perform the installation of Joomla! on your server, and
is changed when you make changes to in the global configuration section
of the Administration of Mambo. This file defines many of the global
variables that Joomla! uses to execute. You can not edit the file from
here, but it does allow you to look at your current settings to find
problems or to copy the information for a support post on the forum on <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/">www.mamboserver.com</a>.<br /><h2>PHP Information<br /></h2>PHP
is the server side scripting language that Joomla! runs on. This language
is installed and executes on the server, and therefore all the settings
are made on that server. Everything you ever wanted to know about the
PHP installation on your Joomla! server is listed here. How much control
you have over changing this information depends on whether you own the
server or if your server host is willing to work with you on needed
changes. The PHP tab will allow you to look at all the settings and
variables that define your PHP installation. It is a good practice to
insure that you know what requirements are needed for any 'Third Party'
Components that you plan to use with Mambo. You can then check for
those requirements here.<br /><h2>Directories Permissions</h2>This lists all directories that should be writable to allow all functions and features of Joomla! to perform as designed. If any is listed as Unwritable, you should CHMOD it.<br />The list does not include some directories that have to be CHMOD to use some specific functions as creating languages, making packages, etc.<br />
