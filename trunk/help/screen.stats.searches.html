You should assess whether you have content that is applicable. If necessary, add keywords using the Meta Info tab for that content item.</p><p>Other results to look for are misspelt words or related words. For example, if a common search word is 'dark' but it is commonly misspelt as 'drak' then you may consider putting 'drak' in the keywords section. You may also have content about a waste facility where you might add common alternative terms in the meta keywords such as 'trash' or 'dump'.</p>
