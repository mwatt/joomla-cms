<h1>What's New in Version 4.5.3</h1>

	<p>This version includes many new features including administrator translation, security hardening, new components, interface improvements and many bug fixes.</p>

<h1>Language Management</h1>

	<p>This is the first version of Joomla! to include a complete translation of form labels and general text for both the site and administrator.
	The language files have been coverted to a simple 'ini' format although the old 'php' format is still supported (but not recommended).
	</p>


<h1>Configuration Variables</h1>

	<dl>
		<dt>mosConfig_debug_db</dt>

		<dd>Displays a log of the queries executed.</dd>
	</dl>

<h1>Administrator Interface</h1>

	<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Important</span>: Whenever you enter most &quot;edit&quot; screens, that is, a screen where there is a &quot;Save&quot; button, the menubar will be hidden from view.&nbsp; This is a safety measure to ensure that a user does not simply navigate to another screen without either saving or cancelling, leaving the item &quot;checked out&quot;.<br /><h1>Templates</h1>

	<p>Many list screen now include the ability to sort by column headings.</p>

<h2>Site Templates</h2>

<h1>Components</h1>

	<h2>Global Check-in</h2>
	<p>Global Check-in has been revised to list those items that are checked-out and allows you to selectively check-in items.
	The component would previously check-in any items without confirmation.</p>

	<h2>Export</h2>
	<p>An Export component is new in this version.  While it can serve as a data backup tool, it also allows for the exporting of data in other formats (for example, XML, XMI, etc).</p>

	<h2>Language Manager</h2>
	<p>The Language Manager has been completely revised to facilitate the maintenance of all language files.</p>



<h1>Mambots</h1>

	<h2>User Authentication</h2>
