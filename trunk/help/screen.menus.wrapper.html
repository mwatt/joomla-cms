<h1>Menu Item: Wrapper</h1>


<p align="right"><!--StartFragment -->&nbsp;-- Draft Version 4.5.3<br /></p><p align="left">The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wrapper</span> Menu Item creates a page that wraps an external Web page into your site. The external Web page is inserted as an 'inline frame' (also called an Iframe) into your template. This is not only useful to display other people's sites but also to include in your site pure DHTML pages you would have created with a specialised Web Editor, because they would be difficult/impossible to create through available Joomla! editors. It also allows you to integrate independent scripts (galleries, directories,..) into your Joomla! site content.</p><h2>Details</h2><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Name: </span>Type here the name of the Menu Item as it will appear on the menu on your site.</p><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wrapper Link:</span> Enter here the URL desired.</p><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">URL: </span>The URL for this item will show after Apply/Save.</p><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Parent Item:</span> Select 'Top' if you want the menu item to appear at the same level as your primary navigation. You can also put the menu item under an existing menu item by selecting that existing menu item as the parent.</p><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ordering:</span> A pull-down menu will show here after using the &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Apply&quot; button, to select the item after which the item will appear. By default, Joomla! adds new items to the end of the list. After creating an item, you can change its order here when editing.</p><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Access Level:</span> Sets who can view this item.</p><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Published:</span> Sets whether the menu item is published or not. By default, new menu items are set to be published.</p><h2>Parameters</h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Menu
Image: </span>Allows you to set an image that would appear to the left or
right of the menu item. The image must be placed in the /images/stories
directory. Furthermore, for the image to show, in Modules -&gt; Site
Modules -&gt; [name-of-menu], the *Show Menu Items* option must be set
to *Yes* in the parameters.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">SSL Enabled:</span> Select whether or not this link should use SSL and the Secure Site URL.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Page Class Suffix:</span> Allows you to set
customized styles for this page. The suffix you type here is
automatically added to the CSS classes for this page, and will have to
be defined in your template's CSS stylesheet for usage.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Back
Button:</span> Controls whether to show or hide a &quot;Back&quot; text link that would
appear on the bottom of the page and return the user to the previously
viewed page. The pull down lets select 'Use Global' to use the
parameter as defined globally through the Site-&gt;Global
Configuration, 'Hide' or 'Show'.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Show/Hide Page Title:</span> Hides or shows the Page Title text (defined in the field described below).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Page Title:</span> Text to display at the top of the page.<br />_______________<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">SEO Title: </span>Enter
here the text to be used in the Title tag of the page. If left blank
the Name of the Menu Item as entered in the Details part of this screen
will be used instead.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meta Keyword:</span> Enter here the Meta keywords to be used for the page.<br /><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Meta Description:</span> Enter here the Meta Description to be used for the page.<br />_______________<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Target Name:</span> Name of the IFrame when used as a target.<br />_______________<br /><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scroll Bars: </span>Determines whether horizontal and vertical scroll bars are added. 'No' means scroll bars are never shown even when content extends beyond the inline frame, 'Yes' means scroll bars are always used even when content does not extend beyond the inline frame, and 'Auto' means scrolls bars are shown only when necessary.</p><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Width:</span> Type in a value for the width of the Iframe window, either in pixels or in percentage. Percentage is relative to the html element where the &lt;?php include_once(&quot;mainbody.php&quot;); ?&gt; tag is placed in the template.</p><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Height: </span>Type in a value for the height of the Iframe window, either in pixels or in percentage (see above).</p><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto Height:</span> Sets whether or not the height of the Wrapper page is set to the size of the external Web page.<br /></p><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">XHTML Compliance:</span> For the auto-height feature to work, this should be set to No (default). If XHTML compliance is of a higher priority, set to Yes. Unfortunately, you can't have both.<br /></p><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto Add: </span>Determines whether or not 'http://' is added to the URL that you type in the Wrapper Link field in the Details tab. If set to 'No,' then you can must type 'http://' or 'https://' at the beginning of the URL in the Wrapper Link field, or else the link in the Wrapper Link field will be treated as a link relative to the URL of your site.</p>
