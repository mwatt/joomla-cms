<h1>Checkin Manager</h1>


<p align="right"><!--StartFragment --> -- Draft 4.5.3<br /></p><div style="text-align: left;"><h2><strong>Checkin Manager<br /></strong></h2></div><p align="left">When a User edits a file, Joomla! changes its status to, &quot;Checked Out&quot;. Thereafter the file is locked and only the User who has &quot;checked it out&quot; has permission to work with it. This is a security feature that prevents two Users from editing a document at the same time, thus preventing loss of data upon saving.<br /><br />An Item remains 'Checked Out' until the User clicks 'Save' or 'Cancel' while editing the Item, at which time the Item is &quot;Checked In&quot;. However, if there's a connection error (the user presses the 'Back' icon in his/her browser, or the User chooses another menu item without saving or canceling the work in progress) the Item remains 'Checked Out'. This means no one can edit it. This is usually reported or experienced as Users being unable to edit or access items, and can be verified by looking&nbsp;at the column labeled &quot;Checked Out&quot; in the various Managers.<br /><br />Joomla! has a protocol, called &quot;Checkin&quot; that allows an administrator to unlock all or specific Items that are currently &quot;Checked Out&quot;. This can be done on an individual base in each concerned Manager, but also on a multiple base through this feature.<br /><br />To perform the &quot;Check In&quot;, select System &gt; Checkin Manager from the Administrator Menubar.&nbsp; After performing the &quot;Check In&quot;, Joomla! returns a list showing how many items, and from which tables, are still checked out..<br /><br /><strong><font color="#cc0000">WARNING:</font></strong> Be very careful in doing this as anyone who is editing a document at that very moment can have his or her work lost.</p><h2>Toolbar Icons</h2><p align="left"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Checkin: </span>Click this icon to checkin the items chosen in the table.<br /></p><h2><font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Filters</span></font></h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">From left to right:</span><br />Search a Content by name.<br />Tables: displays depending on the tables concerned (contents, modules, mambots, etc.).<br />Checked-out by: displays depending on user who performed the checked-out.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Column Descriptions</span></h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Item:</span> a table displays all items currently checked out. <br />Check the box on top
of table to perform global checkin for all items. <br />Alternatively, check
one or multiple items by checking the box next to their title to checkin

items in the list. You can also set the number of items displayed
on a page by selecting the number in the drop down box at the bottom of
the screen.<br />
