<h1>Global Configuration</h1>


<p align="right">- Draft 4.5.3<br /><br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Global Configuration</span> controls Mambo's operational settings. Changes made on this screen will update
the configuration.php file. This file needs to be writable in order
for you to be able to edit your configuration. This information is provided at the bottom of the Navigator. It is a good idea to make the file unwritable after changes are performed.<br /></p><h2>Toolbar Icons</h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save:</span> Saves the changes and returns to the Control Panel/Admin Home page.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Apply: </span>Saves the changes and keeps the Global Configuration displayed to edit.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Close:</span> Cancels the action. Any modification is lost.<br /><br /><h2>Navigator</h2>Provides direct access to the various parameters to be customised.<br />The Navigator is providing 3 types of links.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Site -</span>&gt; Site settings<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Debug<br />Users<br />Meta<br />Statistics<br />SEO<br />Content<br /></div><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.

Cache<br /></span><h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">File Settings</span></h2>Shows if your configuration.php file is writable or not.<br />Check the box to make it unwritable after saving.<br /><br /><h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h2><h2><strong>1. Site Settings</strong></h2><h2><strong></strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site
Offline</span> - Switch your websites
'Front-end ' on or off. Use this option while you are updating modules or data, and do not wish to have your visitors
view the site until you are finished. Remember to reset the &quot;Site offline&quot; option
to &quot;No&quot; once you're done.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Offline Message</span> - When the site is <span>offline </span>(switch on 'Yes' position), this message will appear on the 'Front-end'.&nbsp; The default message is:<br />&quot;This site is down for maintenance. Please check back again soon.&quot;<br />You can change this text to whatever message you would like.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">System
Error Message</span> - This message will display if the initial
database connection fails.&nbsp; You can type anything you like in this
box. We suggest something non-technical, friendly and apologetic, stating that your
site will be available again as soon as possible. You can use standard
HTML code in this box also, for instance, &lt;<span>br</span> /&gt; to return a
line. You might also consider adding an e-mail address, so that your
visitors can contact your System Administrator or the Webmaster.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site
Name</span> - Allows you to set the content of the title bar for
your site. It can also be displayed in your template by inserting the
following code statement into your template file
[Mambo_root/templates/template name/index.php] where you wish your Site
Name to appear:</p><p>%%&lt;?php echo $_CONFIG-&gt;<span>SITENAME</span>; ?&gt;%%<br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WYSIWYG Editor</span> - Used to define which of the installed Text Editors will be used as default.<br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Popup Frontend Editing</span>: If enabled, editing an item in the Frontend will open a pop-up window instead of the default inline editing. The advantage is that you are not restricted by the template used and get more space when editing.<br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">List Length: </span>Sets the default length for lists in the Administrator. Please note that if you have previously visited a page with a list, changing this setting in Global Configuration will not be immediately visible. However, the setting you specify will be honoured as a default upon your next login.<br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Favourites Site Icon</span> - Enter the path to the icon that
appears in some browsers next to the name and/or address of your
site.&nbsp; By default this is the Joomla! flower icon located in the images/stories folder. This file is typically named 'favicon.ico'.<br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Internal Templates: </span>Allows loading of custom Internal Templates for Components, Modules and Mambots. These templates have to be present in the Template directory.<br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Live Bookmarks:</span> Implements support for Firefox Live Bookmark functionnality.<br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Live Bookmark where: </span>Choose between the Home page and all pages to implement Live Bookmarks.<br /></p><h2>Debug Settings</h2><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Debug</span>: Allows you to view the error
messages that are created by your site's php installation. It can be a
handy tool for debugging if you are having problems, and for
reporting errors to your System Administrator or Web host. The levels
of error reporting can be set under the Global Configuration&gt;Server
tab, and are as follows:<br />System Default, None, Simple and Maximum.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Debug Database: </span>displays SQL errors if present.<br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Log Database Queries: </span>display or not log of SQL queries executed (for development purposes).<br /></p><h2>User Tab</h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Allow User Registration: </span>Allows
you to globally set whether visitors to your site can register for a
user account. If set to 'Yes', the Login Form will include the prompt
“No account yet? Create one”. If set to 'No', they will not be
presented with an option to register, only with the name/pass fields to
log into the site.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Usertype of new users:</span>
Choose which type of users new users should automatically be created
as. Choice is between Registered, Author, Editor, Publisher.<br />?Help: Information concerning User Types.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use New Account Activation:</span>
If Yes, an activation link will be sent to user's e-mail address. The
User can not login until he has clicked on the activation link. If No,
the user will be able to login right after his account creation,
without any activation.<br /><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Require Unique E-mail:</span>
Select whether you want to prevent duplicate registration with the same
e-mail address. In combination with user activation this option
prevents users to sign up several times using the same e-mail address.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Show Unauthorised Links: </span>With
this option turned on, all visitors&nbsp; will see content to which they
would otherwise not have access, (that is, content given an Access
Level of 'Registered' or 'Special'). With this option off, they will
only see content with an Access Level of 'Public'.&nbsp; The Access Level
for Content is selected under the Publishing tab for each item
individually.</p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Allow users to change their name:</span> If Yes, users will be able to change their name from the frontend.<br /><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Allow users to change their username: </span>If yes, users will be able to change their username from the frontend.<br /></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Min.

Password length:</span> Set the minimum amount of characters a Password should contain.<br /></p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Frontend User Params: </span>Allows Users to control their extra parameters options (Frontend language, Editor).<br /><h2><strong><span>Metadata</span> Setings</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Global Site Meta
Description:&nbsp;</span> Type a description of your website used to assist Search Engines. You may want
to limit your description to maybe twenty words or so, depending on the
Search Engine you are targeting. Make it concise and pertinent to your
site's contents. You can include some of your keywords and key phrases
here too. As some search engines read more than 20 words you can add
one or two sentences. Make sure that the most important and relevant part of
your description is in the first 20 words, this will generally be displayed in Search Engine results.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Global Site Meta Keywords: </span>The
optimal number of characters for a keyword description is said to be
between 300 and 500. Do not repeat words too often and either separate
your keywords with a comma or a space, or group two or three words
together. 'Joomla! Open Source' would be an example of this.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Show Title Meta Tag: </span>Shows the Title meta tag when viewing content items.<br /><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Show Author Meta Tag</span>: Shows the Authors meta tag when viewing content items.</p><p>The
Description and Keyword Meta tags will have a bearing on how Search
Engines will index your site. Some Search Engines completely ignore
<span>Metadata</span> altogether. You should do some research on Search Engine
Optimization (SEO) if high rankings and Search Engine traffic are important
to you.</p><h2><strong>Statistics Tab</strong></h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Statistics: </span>If this is set to 'Yes', the browser and visitor domain
statistics will be collected on the basis of settings in&nbsp; the
Content Tab. If this is set to 'No', the browser and visitor statistics
will not be collected. If your site experiences a slight 'delay' the
first time a user visits the site you should set this to 'No'.<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Log
Content Hits by Date: </span>Enables logging of the hits on
content items, on a daily basis. There are currently no in-built
analysis routines, to complement this logging feature. <br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Warning:</span> this will tend to collect large amount of data over time.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Log Search
Strings:</span> Enables logging of the search text, entered
by a user. Such logging facilitates the 'tuning' of your web site,
giving you an insight into how your visitors are trying to find the
information they seek. Analysis reporting is provided under
Site-&gt;Statistics-&gt;Search Text.<br /></p><h2><strong><span>SEO</span> Tab</strong></h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Search
Engine Friendly URLs:&nbsp;</span> Changes the way site links are
presented and <span>optimises</span> them so that search engines can access more of
your site. <br />Warning: This option is ONLY available to sites hosted on Apache
servers. If you use this option you must rename the <span>'htaccess</span>.<span>txt'</span> <span>file</span>
in your sites root folder to '.<span>htaccess' (dot included, no extension!)&nbsp;</span> via FTP BEFORE activating. If your server does not support this setting, your site might become unusable!<br /><br />For additional information on SEO see the appendix <a href="http://help.mamboserver.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=796&Itemid=121">here</a>.<br /><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamic Page Titles:&nbsp;</span> Sets the
page titles (that appear at the top on a viewers browser) to reflect page content. This helps search
engines.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Page Titles format:</span>
Choose in the drop-down to show Site -Title, Title - Site or page Title
only. Excludes or includes and positions the site title with the page
title,, if the previous setting (Dynamic Page Titles) is enabled.<br /></p><h2><strong>Content Tab</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Linked Titles:</span> If 'Yes', the title of a content item will hyperlink to the item.&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read More Link:</span> Displays a &quot;Read More&quot; link at the bottom of Content if main text has been provided for the Content.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Item
