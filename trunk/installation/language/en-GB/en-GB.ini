TABLE PREFIX=Table Prefix
TIPBACKUP=Any existing backup tables from former Joomla installations will be replaced
TIPCOLLATIONNONUTF=<p>This version of MySQL does not have UTF-8 support which is the required encoding.</p><p>It is recommended that you upgrade your database to a version newer than 4.1.2. If this is not possible, Joomla! will store utf-8 encoded content in your existing database in a backward compatibility mode. Collation selection is not possible in this mode and a default collation will be used.</p>
TIPCOLLATIONUTF=<p>This version of MySQL includes UTF-8 support which is the required encoding.</p><p>Choose a collation from the list. If none appears for your language, that is because the default collation <em>utf8_general_ci</em> is suitable.</p>
TIPCONFSTEPS=<p>Enter your e-mail address, this will be the e-mail address of the site\n        SuperAdministrator.</p>\n
TIPDATABASE=Some hosts allow only a certain DB name per site. Use table prefix in this case for distinct Joomla sites.
TIPDATABASESTEPS=<p>Setting up Joomla to run on your server involves 4 simple steps...</p>\n		<p>Please enter the hostname of the server Joomla is to be installed on.</p>\n		<p>Enter the MySQL username, password and database name you wish to use with Joomla.</p>\n		<p>Enter a prefix to be used by tables for this Joomla installation. Select how to handle exisitng tables from a previous installation.</p>\n		<p>Install the samples unless you are experienced and want to start with a virtually empty site.</p>\n
TIPFTPCONFSTEPS=<p>Due to filesystem permission restrictions and PHP Safe Mode restrictions.\n        For all users to utilize the Joomla! installers an FTP layer exists to handle filesystem manipulation.<br/><br/>Enter an FTP username and password with access to the Joomla! root directory, this will be the FTP account that handles all filesystem operations when Joomla! requires FTP access to complete a task.<br /><br/>For security reasons, it is best if a separate FTP user account is created with access only to the Joomla! installation.</p>
TIPHOST=This is usually 'localhost'
TIPINSTALLDEFAULT=Installing this is strongly recommended for beginners. It will install default sample content that is included in the Joomla! installation package.
TIPLOADSQL=The SQL scripts need to be in utf-8 encoding and should have the appropriate table prefix. 
TIPPASSWORD=For site security using a password for the mysql account is mandatory
TIPPERMS=In order for Joomla to function\ncorrectly it needs to be able to access or write to certain files\nor directories. If you see "Unwriteable" you need to change the\npermissions on the file or directory to allow Joomla\nto write to it.
TIPPREFIX=Dont use 'bak_' since this is used for backup tables
TIPPREINSTALL=If any of these items are highlighted\nin red then please take actions to correct them. Failure to do so\ncould lead to your Joomla installation not functioning\ncorrectly.
TIPRECOMSETTINGS=These settings are recommended for PHP in order to ensure full\ncompatibility with Joomla.\n<br />\nHowever, Joomla will still operate if your settings do not quite match the recommended.
